# 🐍 Python Practice Sheet

A structured and continuously growing collection of Python problems with solutions — built for learning, revision, and mastery.

This repository started as a personal practice notebook, but gradually evolved into a comprehensive Python problem-solving resource covering fundamentals to intermediate concepts.

# 📌 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Strengthen Python fundamentals

- Build logical thinking & problem-solving ability

- Prepare for coding interviews & exams

- Provide a clean reference for quick revision

- Help beginners understand solutions step-by-step

Instead of memorizing syntax, this sheet focuses on understanding how Python thinks.

# 🎯 Who Is This For?

This repository is perfect for:

- Beginners starting Python

- School / college students

- Anyone revising Python quickly

# ⭐ Final Note

Consistency beats intelligence in programming.

Solve a few problems daily, and Python will stop looking like a language —
it will start feeling like a tool.

# Happy Coding 🚀
